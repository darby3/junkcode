# Functional JavaScript learning

I'm working my way through the book Functional JavaScript by Michael Fogus.

This kind of stuff trips me out and I find I have to type it out to make it make sense. Also experiment with it a bit. Also sometimes just write out in exhaustive detail what chains of functions are actually doing, so I know what's going on.

So there's lots of false starts, comments out console.log statements, and so forth. Not really meant for long-term use.
